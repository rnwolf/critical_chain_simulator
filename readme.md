# Critical Chain Simulator

## What is it?

Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) is a schedule network analysis technique that takes into account task dependencies, limited resources availability (people, equipment, physical space), and buffers necessary to complete the project successfully. CCPM helps project managers plan and manage the projectâ€™s schedule by concentrating on resources used in Critical Path (also known as the Critical Chain). 

Critical Chain Simulator is an easy to use software allowing the user to experiment with CCPM. It was originally created to be used during a training workshop hosted by a French consulting firm. It is Excel VBA based, providing familiar interface to new users. 

This repository does not give access to the full software. It is meant as backup for some modules and objects exported from the VBA project. You can check them out to get a grasp of the work that has been done.
